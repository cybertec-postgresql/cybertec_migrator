- Trigger Type and Level can be changed even if the trigger is excluded
- Column data-types qualified with `SYS` are not translated properly


## Getting Started

### Requirements

## Running the Migrator

The configuration provided with this repository starts the CYBERTEC Migrator via HTTP. The `EXTERNAL_HTTP_PORT` variable in the `.env` file (generated by `./migrator configure`) controls the choice of port on which the Migrator is served.

The configuration is __not meant to be used in production environment__.
Adapt the NGINX configuration in `docker/templates/default.conf.template` to your needs to run the service on HTTPS with proper credentials.

If you don't have access to an Oracle or PostgreSQL database to test the Migrator, use our [Migrator demo database environment](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator_demo).
