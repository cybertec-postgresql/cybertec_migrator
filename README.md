[_CYBERTEC Migrator_](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/products/cybertec-migrator/) is a streamlined and user-friendly tool that helps you to organize and efficiently migrate multiple Oracle databases to PostgreSQL.
In addition to migrating your data professionally and securely with minimum effort, _CYBERTEC Migrator_ allows you to visually monitor and track the whole process at any time.

Do you want to know if the Migrator can migrate your Oracle database to PostgreSQL?
Then [get the Migrator Standard Edition](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/products/cybertec-migrator#form),  a __free version__ of the CYBERTEC Migrator, follow the offline instructions provided in [Getting Started](#offline-installation) section, and try it out.

The blog article [Meet the CYBERTEC Migrator](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/meet-the-cybertec-migrator/) provides a good introduction on how to migrate Oracle's HR demo schema to PostgreSQL.
Alternatively, you may want to watch the complementary [CYBERTEC Migrator YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt4uYyc72accw-Wi1Egn-IcOOSitK5Lcq).

## Getting Started

### Requirements

_CYBERTEC Migrator_ is distributed as a set of [container images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md) that are managed with the help of [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (`>= 1.27.0`)
- `git` (`>= 2.20.1`)
- `bash` (`>= 4.0`)


### Migrator Installation

The _CYBERTEC Migrator_ images can be obtained via two channels
- [Online installation via container registry](#online-installation)
- From an [offline installation](#offline-installation) package for environments in which networking restrictions are imposed

| üí°  | The Migrator Standard Edition is only available as [offline installation package](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/products/cybertec-migrator#form) |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

#### Online installation

  You need an account on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) container image registry.

## Running the Migrator

Use your web browser to access the Migrator on the URL shown in the terminal with `migrator up`. In our example it would be `http://localhost`.

The configuration provided with this repository starts the CYBERTEC Migrator over HTTP. The `EXTERNAL_HTTP_PORT` variable in the `.env` file (generated by `./migrator configure`) controls the choice of port on which the Migrator is served.

The configuration is __not meant to be used in production environment__.
Adapt the NGINX configuration in `docker/templates/default.conf.template` to your needs to run the service on HTTPS with proper credentials.

If you don't have access to an Oracle or PostgreSQL database to test the Migrator, use our [Migrator demo database environment](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator_demo).
