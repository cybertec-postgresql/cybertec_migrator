## What's New

For older releases see [Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md).

### v3.6.0 - 2022-04-26

#### Features

- Add support for __stage post-hook SQL scripts__ to adapt the migration with functionalities not provided by the Migrator.
  The scripts are executed at the end of a stage.
  Typical use cases for such scripts are to create database objects which are not present in the source database, or to define ownership and access permissions.
    - Add a stage post-hook script in the _Stages Tab_.

      </p>
    - Editor for stage hook scripts. It is possible to temporary disable a hook script.

          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.6.0/stage-post-hook-script-editor.png"></img>
      </p>
    - The execution of the stage post-hook scripts are __logged for audit purposes__.

          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.6.0/stage-post-hook-script-logging.png"></img>
      </p>
- Improve _Data stage_: list and range __partitions and sub-partitions__ of partitioned tables are __migrated in parallel__.
- Support migration of `GENERATED AS IDENTITY` constraint.
- Improve user experience:
    - Code editors verify DDL code to provide fast error feedback.
      <p align="left">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.6.0/editor-code-verification.png"></img>
      </p>
    - Add keyboard hotkey `Ctrl`-`Enter` to start migration job execution.

#### Resolved Bugs

- Failed to created migration of an Oracle database containing a column that uses a data-type from the `SYS` schema
- Starting a migration job with more than one stage and incorrect target connection bricks the migration
- Sidebar filter showing schemas that contain none of the filter results
- Misleading console log entries `No metadata found. There is more than once class-validator version installed probably ...`
