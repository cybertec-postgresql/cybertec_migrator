## What's New

For older releases see [Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md).

### v3.4.0

The main focus of this release is improving the performance for reading the source database meta-data (we tested databases with approximately 400.000 database objects).
This includes improvements to the GUI to be responsive with a large number of database objects.

> **NOTE**  
> After starting the migrator the dashboard may show an error until the Migrator converted existing migrations in its internal database.
> Depending on the number and size of existing migrations this may take some time.

#### Features

- Reading and analyzing the source database meta-data is now faster
- *Overview page*: drill down to show specific data types
- Improve *Sidebar*:
    - Show number of database objects
    - Add new `Constraints` Object Type filter (`Check`, `Foreign Keys`, and `Unique/Primary Keys`)
    - Add `Disable Partitioning` for multiple tables
- Improve *Search and Replace*
    - Include index names
    - Scope search with sidebar filter
- Highlight element in the table editor when selected in the sidebar or when navigated from the log view
- *Log View*:
    - Scope log entries based on job execution: `ALL`, `CURRENT MIGRATION`, and `LAST EXECUTED JOB`
    - Download content of log view

#### Resolved Bugs

- Creating a migration of a database with a large number of DBOs fails
- Unable to save large configuration changes
- `Partitions` tab not responsive for a table with large number of partitions (>500)
- Resuming data stage results in migrating the data from a different SCN
- Data stage was not aborted properly by user request


## Getting Started

### Requirements

_CYBERTEC Migrator_ is distributed as a set of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images that are brought up by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (`>= 1.27.0`)
- `git` (`>= 2.20.1`)
- `bash` (`>= 4.0`)

### Obtaining Images

_CYBERTEC Migrator_ images can be obtained through Docker Hub.  
An offline installation package is also available for environments in which networking restrictions are imposed.

- Docker Hub  
  Please [get in touch with us](#contact) if your account has not been granted access to the respective images.

  ```sh
  cat ~/password.txt | docker login --username <username> --password-stdin
  ```

- Offline installation package  
  Please [get in touch with us](#contact) to request download credentials.

### Setup

- Online installation

  1. Clone the repository
  2. Change directory into cloned repository
  3. Generate default configuration
  4. Download images

  <br/>

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator
  cd cybertec_migrator
  ./migrator configure
  ./migrator install
  ```

- Offline installation

  | üí°  | Installation archives also serve as upgrade archives |
    | --- | ---------------------------------------------------- |

  1. Extract the provided archive file
  2. Change directory to the directory created in the previous step
  3. Generate default configuration
  4. Import images from archive

  <br/>

  ```sh
  tar xf cybertec_migrator-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
  cd cybertec_migrator
  ./migrator configure
  ./migrator install --archive ../cybertec_migrator-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
  ```

## Running the Migrator

```sh
./migrator up
```

CYBERTEC Migrator only supports connections via HTTP.

The `EXTERNAL_HTTP_PORT` variable in the `.env` file (generated by `./migrator configure`) controls the choice of port on which the Migrator is served.
