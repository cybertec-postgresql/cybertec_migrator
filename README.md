[_CYBERTEC Migrator_](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/products/cybertec-migrator/) is a streamlined and user-friendly tool that helps you to organize and efficiently migrate multiple Oracle databases to PostgreSQL.
In addition to migrating your data professionally and securely with minimum effort, _CYBERTEC Migrator_ allows you to visually monitor and track the whole process at any time.

Do you want to know if the Migrator can migrate your Oracle database to PostgreSQL?
Then [get the Migrator Standard Edition](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/products/cybertec-migrator#form),  a __free version__ of the CYBERTEC Migrator, follow the offline instructions provided in [Getting Started](#offline-installation) section, and try it out.

## What's New

For older releases see [Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md).

### v3.8.0 - 2022-06-29

#### Features

- Configure the maximal number of parallel data transfers and index creation workers for each migration.  
  The Migrator picks reasonable default values when a new migration is created:
  - `Data Tranfers`: number of CPUs where the Migrator is hosted
  - `Database Workers`: number of CPUs of the target database. Make sure to tune this parameter with the PostgreSQL configuration of [max_worker_processes, max_parallel_workers, max_parallel_maintenance_workers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html)
  <p align="left">
      <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.8.0/settings-parallel-workers.png"></img>
  </p>
- Enhance sidebar: show synonym meta-data as pop-up
  <p align="left">
      <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.8.0/sidebar-shows-synonym-meta-data.png"></img>
  </p>
- Set/clear object type filter by selecting an `Object Type` in the overview tab. Use the `CTRL` key to filter for more than one database object type.

- Add [issue templates](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator/issues/new/choose) for asking questions.

#### Resolved Bugs

* Empty connection check error message on `504 Gateway Time-Out`
* Broken GUI workflow in the Analyze step on `504 Gateway Time-Out`
* Error on migrating `REVERSE` indexes: PostgreSQL does not have/need an equivalent feature
* Opening a non-existent migration endlessly shows the loading animation
* Error on migrating sequences with negative `INCREMENT` - `START value cannot be greater than MAXVALUE`
* Migration controls (resume, continue, etc.) occasionally do not behave as expected
* Views depending on other views are not created in the correct order
* Spacing between the migration log time and level is jumping
* Incorrect name conflict detection for tables and triggers with the same identifier

## Getting Started

### Requirements

_CYBERTEC Migrator_ is distributed as a set of [container images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md) that are managed with the help of [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (`>= 1.27.0`)
- `git` (`>= 2.20.1`)
- `bash` (`>= 4.0`)


### Migrator Installation

The _CYBERTEC Migrator_ images can be obtained via two channels
- [Online installation via container registry](#online-installation)
- From an [offline installation](#offline-installation) package for environments in which networking restrictions are imposed

| üí°  | The Migrator Standard Edition is only available as [offline installation package](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/products/cybertec-migrator#form) |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

#### Online installation

  You need an account on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) container image registry.

  Please [get in touch with us](#contact) if your account has not been granted access to the respective images.
  Make sure you are logged in the Docker Hub registry with the correct user.

  ```sh
  cat ~/password.txt | docker login --username <username> --password-stdin
  ```

  1. Clone this git repository
  2. Change working directory to the previously cloned repository
  3. Generate default configuration
  4. Download and load container images
  5. Start the Migrator

  ```sh
  ‚ûú git clone https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator
  ‚ûú cd cybertec_migrator

  For the Professional or Enterprise Edition [get in touch with us](#contact) to request download credentials.

  1. Extract the provided archive file
  2. Change working directory to newly created directory
  3. Generate default configuration
  4. Import container images from archive

## Running the Migrator

Use your web browser to access the Migrator on the URL shown in the terminal with `migrator up`. In our example it would be `http://localhost`.

The configuration provided with this repository starts the CYBERTEC Migrator over HTTP. The `EXTERNAL_HTTP_PORT` variable in the `.env` file (generated by `./migrator configure`) controls the choice of port on which the Migrator is served.

The configuration is __not meant to be used in production environment__.
Adapt the NGINX configuration in `docker/templates/default.conf.template` to your needs to run the service on HTTPS with proper credentials.

If you don't have access to an Oracle or PostgreSQL database to test the Migrator, use our [Migrator demo database environment](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator_demo).
