[_CYBERTEC Migrator_](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/products/cybertec-migrator/) is a streamlined and user-friendly tool that helps you to organize and efficiently migrate multiple Oracle databases to PostgreSQL.
In addition to migrating your data professionally and securely with minimum effort, _CYBERTEC Migrator_ allows you to visually monitor and track the whole process at any time.

Do you want to know if the Migrator can migrate your Oracle database to PostgreSQL?
Then [get the Migrator Trial Edition](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/products/cybertec-migrator#form), a **free version** of the CYBERTEC Migrator, follow the offline instructions provided in [Getting Started](#offline-installation) section, and try it out.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

_CYBERTEC Migrator_ is distributed as a set of [container images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md) that are managed with the help of [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [`docker compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (`>= 2.0.0`)
- `git` (`>= 2.20.1`)
- `bash` (`>= 4.0`)

### Migrator Installation

The _CYBERTEC Migrator_ images can be obtained via two channels

- [Online installation via container registry](#online-installation)
- From an [offline installation](#offline-installation) package for environments in which networking restrictions are imposed

| 💡 | The Migrator Trial Edition is only available as an [offline installation package](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/products/cybertec-migrator#form). <br/><br/> It is exclusively intended for private or testing purposes, unless explicit authorization is obtained. |

## Running the Migrator

Use your web browser to access the Migrator on the URL shown in the terminal with `migrator up`. In our example it would be `https://localhost`.

The configuration provided with this repository starts the CYBERTEC Migrator on the standard HTTPS port.
The `EXTERNAL_HTTP_PORT` variable in the `.env` file (generated by `./migrator configure`) controls the choice of port on which the Migrator is served.

If you don't have access to an Oracle or PostgreSQL database to test the Migrator, use our [Migrator demo database environment](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator_demo).

### Upgrades

| ⚠️  | Running migrations _will_ be interrupted by applying upgrades |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

> **Attention**  
> If you upgrade from a Migrator version previous of 3.11.0 you have to create the TLS/SSL certificate after upgrading to the new version, **before restarting** the new Migrator.
>
> ```sh
> ./migrator update
> ./migrator upgrade
> # Don't forget the create or install a TLS/SSL certificate
> ./migrator configure --tls self-signed-cert
> ./migrator up
> ```

- Online upgrade

  1. Update release information
  2. Upgrade to newest version
  3. Apply upgrade

  <br/>

  ```sh
  ./migrator update
  ./migrator upgrade
  ./migrator up
  ```

- Offline upgrade

  | 💡  | Installation archives also serve for upgrading the Migrator |
  | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

  1. Update release information
  2. Upgrade to version bundled in archive
  3. Apply upgrade

  <br/>
