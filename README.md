## What's New

For older releases see [Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md).

- `v3.2.0`

  **Features**

  - Enhanced migration configuration:
    - Index Renaming  
      Rename indices in case there are naming collisions with other database objects

    - Primary/Unique Key Modification  
      Add, remove and change the order of table columns in a primary/unique key

  - Browser Tab Syncing  
    Work on the same migration in multiple browser tabs, with them being synced in real-time

  - *Search and Replace* on check constraints and expression indexes

  - Usability Improvements
    - Improved sidebar functionalities:
        - Object Type filter: add options for indices, triggers, and sequences
        - Bulk exclude of schemata and tables
    - The different tabs in the table editor (Columns, Constraints, etc.) display the identifiers used in the target database
    - Provide examples for source and target connection strings when creating new migrations
    - Performance improvements when running migration jobs
    - Provide more concise error details when writing database objects to the target database (e.g. miss-matching foreign key data-types)

  **Resolved Bugs**

  - Creating a migration of a database with a view with numerous columns causes a failure during meta-data import (`ORA-40478: output value too large (maximum: 4000)`)
  - Creating a migration with an unreachable host shows a non-descriptive error
  - *Replace All* on different database object types sometimes doesn't replace all search results

## Getting Started

### Requirements

_CYBERTEC Migrator_ is distributed as a set of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images that are brought up by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (`>= 1.27.0`)
- `git` (`>= 2.20.1`)
- `bash` (`>= 4.0`)

### Obtaining Images

_CYBERTEC Migrator_ images can be obtained through Docker Hub.  
An offline installation package is also available for environments in which networking restrictions are imposed.

- Docker Hub  
  Please [get in touch with us](#contact) if your account has not been granted access to the respective images.

  ```sh
  cat ~/password.txt | docker login --username <username> --password-stdin
  ```

- Offline installation package  
  Please [get in touch with us](#contact) to request download credentials.

### Setup

- Online installation

  1. Clone the repository
  2. Change directory into cloned repository
  3. Generate default configuration
  4. Download images

  <br/>

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator
  cd cybertec_migrator
  ./migrator configure
  ./migrator install
  ```

- Offline installation

  | 💡  | Installation archives also serve as upgrade archives |
    | --- | ---------------------------------------------------- |

  1. Extract the provided archive file
  2. Change directory to the directory created in the previous step
  3. Generate default configuration
  4. Import images from archive

  <br/>

  ```sh
  tar xf cybertec_migrator-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
  cd cybertec_migrator
  ./migrator configure
  ./migrator install --archive ../cybertec_migrator-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
  ```

## Running the Migrator

```sh
./migrator up
```

CYBERTEC Migrator only supports connections via HTTP.

The `EXTERNAL_HTTP_PORT` variable in the `.env` file (generated by `./migrator configure`) controls on which port the Migrator is served.

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

- Online upgrade

  1. Update release information
  2. Upgrade to newest version
  3. Apply upgrade

  <br/>

  ```sh
  ./migrator update
  ./migrator upgrade
  ./migrator up
  ```

- Offline upgrade

  1. Update release information
  2. Upgrade to version bundled in archive
  3. Apply upgrade

  <br/>

  ```sh
