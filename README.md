## What's New

For older releases see [Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md).

### v3.5.0-rc.2

#### Features

- Several improvements in the execution of a migration:
    - Swap **execution order of *Integrity* and *Logic* stage**.
      Having indices in the Logic stage makes it easier to test performance of views, stored procedures and triggers.
      <p align="center">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.5.0/change-stage-execution-order.png"></img>
      </p>
    - Move **creation of [check constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-CHECK-CONSTRAINTS) from Logic into Structure stage**.
      Checking the data during the data bulk load is negligible compared to the time needed to re-read the table from disk in the Logic stage.
    - As a consequence, **functions are created in the Structure stage** prior to tables, since they may be used by check constraints.
      The Logic stage re-creates the functions once again still providing the means for fast change-test round-trips.
- The _Migration Overview_ was updated to reflect the changes in the migration execution:
    - It is visible in which order the database objects are created: first schemas, then user defined types, followed by sequences, etc.
      <p align="center">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.5.0/overview-shows-stage-execution.png"></img>
      </p>
    - Provide drill down on _Indices_ entry to show the number of unique indices. We will enrich the _Migration Overview_ with additional information in future releases.
      <p align="center">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.5.0/overview-show-unique-indices.png"></img>
      </p>
- Enhance migration configuration:
    - Constraint Renaming  
      Rename constraints in case there are naming collisions with other database objects.
      <p align="center">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.5.0/constraints-rename.png"></img>
      </p>
- Improve handling of implicitly created indices via [Unique Constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-UNIQUE-CONSTRAINTS) or [Primary Keys](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-PRIMARY-KEYS):
    - Show implicitly created indices in the sidebar and the _Indices_ view. In our example, `dept_id_pk` is shown in the _Constraints_ as well as the _Indices_ section.
    - A hyperlink in the _Indices_ view facilitates navigation to the constraint.
      <p align="center">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.5.0/indices-show-unique-indices.png"></img>
      </p>
    - Rename implicitly created indices by renaming its constraint.
- *Log view* shows detailed information about the started migration job:
  <p align="center">
      <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.5.0/log.provide-job-information.png"></img>
  </p>
- Improve *Sidebar*:
    - Object Type Filter: add option for User Defined Types (UDT).

#### Resolved Bugs

- Cloning a migration fails due to missing database object in the source database (dropped or renamed table, dropped column, etc.)
- Integrity stage `ERROR: timeout exceeded when trying to connect`
- Integrity stage keeps processing workers after an error even with enabled "Abort stage on first error"
- Resume of an aborted job fails when the Migrator core was forcefully shut down
- Core dump due to repeated, large error message (`warn: Unable to process subpartition ... table not found`)
- Functional index with an expression containing a number was not migrated
- Overview page does now show 0 database links, synonyms, packages

## Getting Started

### Requirements

_CYBERTEC Migrator_ is distributed as a set of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images that are brought up by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (`>= 1.27.0`)
- `git` (`>= 2.20.1`)
- `bash` (`>= 4.0`)

### Obtaining Images

_CYBERTEC Migrator_ images can be obtained through Docker Hub.  
An offline installation package is also available for environments in which networking restrictions are imposed.

- Docker Hub  
  Please [get in touch with us](#contact) if your account has not been granted access to the respective images.

  ```sh
  cat ~/password.txt | docker login --username <username> --password-stdin
  ```

- Offline installation package  
  Please [get in touch with us](#contact) to request download credentials.

### Setup

- Online installation

  1. Clone the repository
  2. Change directory into cloned repository
  3. Generate default configuration
  4. Download images

  <br/>

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator
  cd cybertec_migrator
  ./migrator configure
  ./migrator install
  ```

- Offline installation

  | üí°  | Installation archives also serve as upgrade archives |
    | --- | ---------------------------------------------------- |

  1. Extract the provided archive file
  2. Change directory to the directory created in the previous step
  3. Generate default configuration
  4. Import images from archive

  <br/>

  ```sh
  tar xf cybertec_migrator-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
  cd cybertec_migrator
  ./migrator configure
  ./migrator install --archive ../cybertec_migrator-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
  ```

## Running the Migrator

```sh
./migrator up
```

CYBERTEC Migrator only supports connections via HTTP.

The `EXTERNAL_HTTP_PORT` variable in the `.env` file (generated by `./migrator configure`) controls the choice of port on which the Migrator is served.

### Upgrades

| ‚ö†Ô∏è  | Running migrations _will_ be interrupted by applying upgrades |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

- Online upgrade

  1. Update release information
  2. Upgrade to newest version
  3. Apply upgrade

  <br/>

  ```sh
  ./migrator update
  ./migrator upgrade
  ./migrator up
  ```

- Offline upgrade

  1. Update release information
  2. Upgrade to version bundled in archive
  3. Apply upgrade

  <br/>

  ```sh
  ./migrator update --archive cybertec_migrator-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
  ./migrator upgrade --archive cybertec_migrator-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
  ./migrator up
  ```
