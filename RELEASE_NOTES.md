## CYBERTEC Migrator - Release Notes

The release notes of the last release may be found on [README.md](README.md#whats-new).

### v3.11.0 - 2022-09-28

#### Features

- Add support for Oracle 11 (closes #14).
- We changed the default configuration of the reverse proxy to use HTTPS.  
  This means you have to **install a TLS/SSL certificate** or create a self signed certificate, otherwise the web-server will refuse to start.
  To facilitate the installation of the certificate we added a new option `--tls` to the `migrator configure` command.
  Check out the [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for detailed information how to install a TLS/SSL certificate.

  ```sh
  migrator configure --tls self-signed-cert       Generate self-signed TLS/SSL certificate
  migrator configure --tls cert:<file-location>   Install TLS/SSL certificate
  migrator configure --tls key:<file-location>    Install private key of TLS/SSL certificate
  ```
  > **Attention**  
  > If you upgrade from a previous Migrator version you have to create the TLS/SSL certificate after upgrading to the new version, **before restarting** the new Migrator.
  >
  > ```sh
  > ./migrator update
  > ./migrator upgrade
  > # Don't forget the create or install a TLS/SSL certificate
  > ./migrator configure --tls self-signed-cert
  > ./migrator up
  > ```
- Add support for **secured communication** (TCPS) access to Oracle databases. For details check our [FAQ - How do I configure TCPS for Oracle databases?](docs/faq.md#how-do-i-configure-tcps-for-oracle-databases).
- Read meta-data of additional Oracle database object types: **jobs** and **operators**

    <img height="250px" src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.11.0/read-operators-meta-data.png" />
  </p>
- Users may provide a custom **Data Query**, thus manipulating the `SELECT` statement executed on the source database to migrate the data.
  <p align="left">
    <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.11.0/custom-data-query.png" />
  </p>
  A few use cases where this feature may be useful:

  - Migrate the table partially by filtering rows with `WHERE`
  - Migrate only the table structure but no data (`WHERE ROWID < 0`)
  - You want to keep the table structure, but not the data of a specific column (see screenshot above)
  - Retrieve (and thus insert) the data in a specific `ORDER BY`
  - Convert the column data of an unsupported data type into a string representation which can be “cast” into a valid PostgreSQL type via the COPY statement
- Improve output for erroneous SQL execution when reading Oracle meta-data.

#### Resolved Bugs

- Columns starting with `SYS` are not included in primary keys or unique constraints
- Data stage fails when column is named after an SQL reserved keywords (for example `IN`)


### v3.10.1 - 2022-09-08

#### Resolved Bugs

- Creating a migration for Oracle 11 and below fails on reading out sequences due to a non-existent table
- The `lower_bound` of range subpartitions is not determined correctly during migration creation
- Running the Structure stage with `REFERENCE` partitions results in a non-descriptive error
- Regression in v3.10.0 causing the data of individual partitions to not be migrated correctly
- Code editors mark their complete content as erroneous instead of only the faulty section
- Revert style changes in the search and replace panel

### v3.10.0 - 2022-08-31

#### Features

- Improve _Search Panel_:
    - Search package specifications and bodies
    - Consolidate DBO type filter into a single input
      <p align="left">
        <img height="450px" src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.10.0/replace-panel-object-type-filter.png" />
      </p>
    - Select multiple search results to replace at once
        - `Shift-Click` to add multiple rows
        - `Ctrl-Click` to add/remove a single row
      <p align="left">
        <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.10.0/replace-panel-multi-selection.gif" />
      </p>
    - Improve keyboard navigation when using `<Tab>`

  <p align="left">
    <img height="200px" src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.10.0/sidebar-shows-queue-meta-data.png" />
  </p>

#### Resolved Bugs

- DBO creation fails due to global `lock_timeout` setting on target database
- Running `ps` inside the core container during the data stage reveals the database passwords
- Abort of data stage may sometimes hang indefinitely

### v3.9.0 - 2022-07-26

#### Features

- Improve _Sidebar_:
    - Show meta-data as pop-up for constraints and indices
      <p align="left">
          <img height="200px" src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.9.0/sidebar-shows-constraint-meta-data.png" />
          <img height="200px" src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.9.0/sidebar-shows-index-meta-data.png" />
      </p>
    - Extend the Object Type filter options with `Partitions` and provide granularity for `Indexes` (`Unique`, `Functional`, and `Domain`)
      <p align="left">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.9.0/filter-on-index-type.png" />
      </p>
- _Migration Overview_: Additional index types on _Indices_ drill down
      <p align="left">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.9.0/overview-show-index-types.png" />
      </p>
- Switch Migrator core to the native `libpq` PostgreSQL driver to support additional authentication methods (e.g. GSSAPI)
- Recurring security maintenance: upgrade package dependencies with known vulnerabilities to newest version

#### Resolved Bugs

* PostgreSQL authentication with AuthenticationGSS causes a crash
* Importing an Oracle View with a Null-Byte results in an unresponsive state
* Unexpected shutdown of the target PostgreSQL connection may cause a crash

### v3.8.0 - 2022-06-29

#### Features

- Configure the maximal number of parallel data transfers and index creation workers for each migration.  
  The Migrator picks reasonable default values when a new migration is created:
  - `Data Tranfers`: number of CPUs where the Migrator is hosted
  - `Database Workers`: number of CPUs of the target database. Make sure to tune this parameter with the PostgreSQL configuration of [max_worker_processes, max_parallel_workers, max_parallel_maintenance_workers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html)
  <p align="left">
      <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.8.0/settings-parallel-workers.png"></img>
  </p>
- Enhance sidebar: show synonym meta-data as pop-up
  <p align="left">
      <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.8.0/sidebar-shows-synonym-meta-data.png"></img>
  </p>
- Set/clear object type filter by selecting an `Object Type` in the overview tab. Use the `CTRL` key to filter for more than one database object type.
  <p align="left">
      <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.8.0/set-object-type-filter-from-overview-tab.png"></img>
  </p>
- Add [issue templates](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator/issues/new/choose) for asking questions.

#### Resolved Bugs

- Empty connection check error message on `504 Gateway Time-Out`
- Broken GUI workflow in the Analyze step on `504 Gateway Time-Out`
- Error on migrating `REVERSE` indexes: PostgreSQL does not have/need an equivalent feature
- Opening a non-existent migration endlessly shows the loading animation
- Error on migrating sequences with negative `INCREMENT` - `START value cannot be greater than MAXVALUE`
- Migration controls (resume, continue, etc.) occasionally do not behave as expected
- Views depending on other views are not created in the correct order
- Spacing between the migration log time and level is jumping
- Incorrect name conflict detection for tables and triggers with the same identifier

### v3.7.0 - 2022-05-18

Do you want to know if the Migrator can migrate your Oracle database to PostgreSQL?

Then [get the Migrator Standard Edition](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/products/cybertec-migrator#form),  a __free version__ (as in beer) of the CYBERTEC Migrator, follow the offline instructions provided in [Getting Started](#offline-installation) section, and try it out.

#### Features

- Improve migration job execution (which removed the Redis job queue as a dependency)
- Provide help menu to reach out to CYBERTEC
- Provide a [Migrator demo database environment](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/cybertec_migrator_demo) to facilitate a test-run of the Migrator Standard Edition
- Added [License](#license) information

#### Resolved Bugs

- Error when attempting to edit a function, procedure, trigger or view containing a `#` in its name
- Trigger Type and Level can be changed even if the trigger is excluded
- Column data-types qualified with `SYS` are not translated properly

### v3.6.0 - 2022-04-26

#### Features

- Add support for __stage post-hook SQL scripts__ to adapt the migration with functionalities not provided by the Migrator.
  The scripts are executed at the end of a stage.
  Typical use cases for such scripts are to create database objects which are not present in the source database, or to define ownership and access permissions.
    - Add a stage post-hook script in the _Stages Tab_.
      <p align="left">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.6.0/stage-post-hook-scripts.png"></img>
      </p>
    - Editor for stage hook scripts. It is possible to temporary disable a hook script.
      <p align="left">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.6.0/stage-post-hook-script-editor.png"></img>
      </p>
    - The execution of the stage post-hook scripts are __logged for audit purposes__.
      <p align="left">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.6.0/stage-post-hook-script-logging.png"></img>
      </p>
- Improve _Data stage_: list and range __partitions and sub-partitions__ of partitioned tables are __migrated in parallel__.
- Support migration of `GENERATED AS IDENTITY` constraint.
- Improve user experience:
    - Code editors verify DDL code to provide fast error feedback.
      <p align="left">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.6.0/editor-code-verification.png"></img>
      </p>
    - Add keyboard hotkey `Ctrl`-`Enter` to start migration job execution.

#### Resolved Bugs

- Failed to created migration of an Oracle database containing a column that uses a data-type from the `SYS` schema
- Starting a migration job with more than one stage and incorrect target connection bricks the migration
- Sidebar filter showing schemas that contain none of the filter results
- Misleading console log entries `No metadata found. There is more than once class-validator version installed probably ...`

### v3.5.0 - 2022-03-29

#### Features

- Several improvements in the execution of a migration:
    - Swap **execution order of *Integrity* and *Logic* stage**.
      Having indices in the Logic stage makes it easier to test performance of views, stored procedures and triggers.
      <p align="left">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.5.0/change-stage-execution-order.png"></img>
      </p>
    - Move **creation of [check constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-CHECK-CONSTRAINTS) from Logic into Structure stage**.
      Checking the data during the data bulk load is negligible compared to the time needed to re-read the table from disk in the Logic stage.
    - As a consequence, **functions are created in the Structure stage** prior to tables, since they may be used by check constraints.
      The Logic stage re-creates the functions once again still providing the means for fast change-test round-trips.
- The _Migration Overview_ was updated to reflect the changes in the migration execution:
    - It is visible in which order the database objects are created: first schemas, then user defined types, followed by sequences, etc.
      <p align="left">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.5.0/overview-shows-stage-execution.png"></img>
      </p>
    - Provide drill down on _Indices_ entry to show the number of unique indices. We will enrich the _Migration Overview_ with additional information in future releases.
      <p align="left">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.5.0/overview-show-unique-indices.png"></img>
      </p>
- Enhance migration configuration:
    - Constraint Renaming  
      Rename constraints in case there are naming collisions with other database objects.
      <p align="left">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.5.0/constraints-rename.png"></img>
      </p>
- Improve handling of implicitly created indices via [Unique Constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-UNIQUE-CONSTRAINTS) or [Primary Keys](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-PRIMARY-KEYS):
    - Show implicitly created indices in the sidebar and the _Indices_ view. In our example, `dept_id_pk` is shown in the _Constraints_ as well as the _Indices_ section.
    - A hyperlink in the _Indices_ view facilitates navigation to the constraint.
      <p align="left">
          <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.5.0/indices-show-unique-indices.png"></img>
      </p>
    - Rename implicitly created indices by renaming its constraint.
- *Log view* shows detailed information about the started migration job:
  <p align="left">
      <img src="./docs/pictures/release-notes/v3.5.0/log.provide-job-information.png"></img>
  </p>
- Improve *Sidebar*:
    - Object Type Filter: add option for User Defined Types (UDT).

#### Resolved Bugs

- Cloning a migration fails due to missing database object in the source database (dropped or renamed table, dropped column, etc.)
- Integrity stage `ERROR: timeout exceeded when trying to connect`
- Integrity stage keeps processing workers after an error even with enabled "Abort stage on first error"
- Resume of an aborted job fails when the Migrator core was forcefully shut down
- Core dump due to repeated, large error message (`warn: Unable to process subpartition ... table not found`)
- Functional index with an expression containing a number was not migrated
- Overview page does now show 0 database links, synonyms, packages

### v3.4.3 - 2022-03-04

This is a bugfix release for [v3.4.0](RELEASE_NOTES.md).

> **Note**: v3.4.1 and v3.4.2 were not released.

#### Resolved Bugs

- Foreign keys are not created in parallel
- Import fails for databases with a view on a view
- Import fails for databases with a partition of a non-imported table (i.e. temporary, secondary, nested, or dropped table)

### v3.4.2

Not released.

### v3.4.1

Not released.

### v3.4.0 - 2022-02-24

The main focus of this release is improving the performance for reading the source database meta-data (we tested databases with approximately 400.000 database objects).
This includes improvements to the GUI to be responsive with a large number of database objects.

> **NOTE**  
> After starting the migrator the dashboard may show an error until the Migrator converted existing migrations in its internal database.
> Depending on the number and size of existing migrations this may take some time.

#### Features

- Reading and analyzing the source database meta-data is now faster
- *Overview page*: drill down to show specific data types
- Improve *Sidebar*:
    - Show number of database objects
    - Add new `Constraints` Object Type filter (`Check`, `Foreign Keys`, and `Unique/Primary Keys`)
    - Add `Disable Partitioning` for multiple tables
- Improve *Search and Replace*
    - Include index names
    - Scope search with sidebar filter
- Highlight element in the table editor when selected in the sidebar or when navigated from the log view
- *Log View*:
    - Scope log entries based on job execution: `ALL`, `CURRENT MIGRATION`, and `LAST EXECUTED JOB`
    - Download content of log view

#### Resolved Bugs

- Creating a migration of a database with a large number of DBOs fails
- Unable to save large configuration changes
- `Partitions` tab not responsive for a table with large number of partitions (>500)
- Resuming data stage results in migrating the data from a different SCN
- Data stage was not aborted properly by user request


### v3.3.0 - 2021-12-21

#### Features

  - Show information of additional Oracle database object types
    - Database links
    - Packages (specification and body)
    - Synonyms
  - Show procedures and functions as separate types (until now both types were shown under `Functions`)
  - Improve data transfer for Oracle `BLOB, CLOB, NCLOB` and `BFILE` columns for rows with big LOBs.
    This may fix out-of-memory errors on the Oracle side, namely `MSG: ORA-01062: unable to allocate memory for define buffer`.
    It also _significantly_ reduces the Migrator memory footprint.
  - The transfer of a row containing a LOB bigger than 500MB will abort with an informative error message.

#### Resolved Bugs

  - Creating a migration of a database with invisible columns causes a failure during meta-data import
    (`null value in column "position" of relation "table_column" violates not-null constraint`)


### v3.2.0 - 2021-11-26

#### Features

- Enhanced migration configuration:
  - Index Renaming  
    Rename indices in case there are naming collisions with other database objects
  - Primary/Unique Key Modification  
    Add, remove and change the order of table columns in a primary/unique key
- Browser Tab Syncing  
  Work on the same migration in multiple browser tabs, with them being synced in real-time
- *Search and Replace* on check constraints and expression indexes
- Usability Improvements
  - Improved sidebar functionalities:
      - Object Type filter: add options for indices, triggers, and sequences
      - Bulk exclude of schemata and tables
  - The tabs in the table editor (Columns, Constraints, etc.) display the identifiers used in the target database
  - Provide examples for source and target connection strings when creating new migrations
  - Performance improvements when running migration jobs
  - Provide more concise error details when writing database objects to the target database (e.g. miss-matching foreign key data-types)

#### Resolved Bugs

  - Creating a migration of a database with a view containing numerous columns causes a failure during meta-data import (`ORA-40478: output value too large (maximum: 4000)`)
  - Creating a migration with an unreachable host shows a non-descriptive error
  - *Replace All* on different database object types sometimes doesn't replace all search results


### v3.1.0 - 2021-10-20

#### Features

- *Search and Replace*  
  Perform bulk changes on column data types / default values, functions, views, and triggers (with support for even more object properties coming soon)

- Significant Speed Improvements  
  **Feel** the difference

- Resume Failed Stages  
  Spend less time fixing those last few migration errors

- Realtime Syntax Checking  
  Get immediate feedback about the syntactical correctness of code
